# Paper

Our goal in this working paper is to articulate a research and practice direction around bridging systems. You can [read the full paper here](#). The abstract is below.

> Divisiveness appears to be increasing in much of the world, leading to concern about political violence and a decreasing capacity to collaboratively address large-scale societal challenges. In this working paper we aim to articulate an interdisciplinary research and practice area focused around what we call *bridging systems*: systems which increase mutual understanding and trust across divides, creating space for productive conflict, deliberation, or cooperation. We give examples of bridging systems across three domains: recommender systems on social media, software for conducting civic forums, and human-facilitated group deliberation. We argue that these examples can be more meaningfully understood as processes for *attention-allocation* (as opposed to “content distribution”), and develop a corresponding framework to explore similarities—and opportunities for bridging—across these seemingly disparate domains. We focus particularly on the potential of *bridging-based ranking* to bring the benefits of offline bridging into spaces which are already algorithmically mediated. Throughout, we survey related work including existing precedents for bridging systems, and suggest research directions that would improve our capacity to develop such systems.
