node-level homophily	homophily	The degree to which an node is connected to nodes similar to itself.	individual	graph	groups	$$\frac{d_i(v)}{d(v)}$$	- Interpretation can depend heavily on the relative sizes of the groups. (For example $H_i=0.5$ might imply significant polarisation if $A_i$ is small (say, 10% of the population), but would be consistent with no homophily if $A_i$ is 50% of the population.)
